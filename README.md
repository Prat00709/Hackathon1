Project Overview

This project focuses on building a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) diagnosis using medical and demographic data. It compares multiple classification models and provides an interactive dashboard for model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

What the project does:

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and scales features to prepare the dataset for model training.

Model Training & Comparison: Trains five different classifiers—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting—and evaluates their performance on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Enables users to fine-tune each model interactively via Streamlit sliders and dropdowns.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes performance comparisons between untuned and tuned models to help data scientists and healthcare professionals identify the most effective model.

Why it matters:

Early and accurate diagnosis of PCOS is critical for mitigating long-term health risks in women. This platform helps practitioners and researchers assess classification models using real-world medical data, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and optimization in diagnostic modeling.
By evaluating various machine learning models and allowing for real-time tuning and visualization, this project helps:

Identify the most suitable classification algorithm for diagnosing PCOS.

Make model selection and optimization transparent and intuitive.

Empower healthcare professionals with data-driven decision tools for better outcomes.

This tool can be adapted for other medical classification tasks as well, offering a generalizable framework for model comparison and interpretability.
